Lung cancer stands as a formidable adversary in the landscape of oncology, accounting for a significant portion of cancer-related fatalities globally. Despite advancements in medical technology and therapeutic strategies, lung cancer prognosis remains grim, largely due to late-stage diagnoses and limited treatment efficacy. The pivotal role of early detection in improving patient outcomes underscores the urgency to enhance diagnostic methodologies for lung cancer.
In recent years, the integration of deep learning algorithms into medical imaging analysis has sparked considerable interest in the quest for more effective lung cancer detection methods. Deep learning, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), holds promise in its ability to autonomously decipher intricate patterns and features embedded within medical images such as chest X-rays and CT scans. By harnessing the potential of deep learning algorithms, researchers and healthcare professionals aim to bolster the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer detection, with the ultimate goal of facilitating earlier diagnoses and improving patient prognoses.
This documentation embarks on an exploration of the application of deep learning algorithms—ranging from inbuilt MLP classifiers to custom MLP models and simple feedforward neural networks (SFNNs)—in the realm of lung cancer detection. Through the meticulous analysis of medical imaging data and the evaluation of diverse deep learning architectures, we endeavour to dissect the performance, efficacy, and practical implications of these algorithms in real-world clinical scenarios. By shedding light on the capabilities, limitations, and emerging challenges inherent in deep learning-based lung cancer detection, this documentation seeks to contribute to the ongoing pursuit of enhanced diagnostic methodologies and improved treatment outcomes for lung cancer patients.
